# Mind-your-language

##Mission: 
Breaking Language Barriers in Knowledge and Communication

##Core Belief: 
Lost in translation is a proverb used significantly to showcase how languages lose its true essence when translated. Money can't buy shared understanding, unless you hire a translator to be with you 24/7.
Money can't buy shared understanding, context, emotion, slang, cultural nuance. Elon Musk built Spacex because he could not buy a ticket to Mars from someone else (it didn't exist). We will be building a language model that translates literally everything to any language in the world. 


##Core Idea:
To begin with we are building a real-time voice translator app/device for travelers, immigrants, expats, global B2B meetings.

##Why This Matters

Knowledge is locked behind language, English dominates. so much wisdom in Sanskrit, Kannada, Tamil, Chinese, Arabic, Spanish is untapped.
- Research, courses, debates are siloed
- Businesses avoid markets because of language friction
- customer support, sales, onboarding suffers
- GTM strategies break down
- media is flat when translated
- humor, emotion, cultural references get lost you miss feeling the story
- immigrants, refugees, travelers — they struggle daily with doctors, shopkeepers, government officials
- developers in non-english countries can't learn fast since code, documentation, stackoverflow everything is in English

##So what?
if we fix this — we open up:
new markets
new users
new knowledge
a more emotionally connected world
this isn't a translation tool. this is an infrastructure for the post-language internet.

##This idea came from me helping my father learn coding in Hindi.

People have curiosity, but the friction of learning tech in another language leaves people procrastinating from getting into tech. There are other fields for sure, will only know once we explore.
